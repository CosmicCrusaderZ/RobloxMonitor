- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Dependencies are already installed. If you need to reinstall:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

Create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage

1. **Default Games**: The app loads two example games on startup:
   - The Church Of Spawnism
   - Catalog Avatar Creator

2. **Add New Game**: 
   - Copy any Roblox game URL (e.g., `https://www.roblox.com/games/GAME_ID/Game-Name`)
   - Paste it into the input field at the top
   - Click "Add Game"

3. **Remove Game**: 
   - Click the red "âœ•" button in the top-right corner of any game section

4. **View Charts**: 
   - Switch between Daily, Hourly, and 10-Minute views using the chart tabs

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Recharts** - Data visualization library
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests
- **Roblox API** - Game data source

## API Integration

The app integrates with Roblox's public APIs:
- `games.roblox.com/v1/games` - Game details
- `thumbnails.roblox.com/v1/games/icons` - Game thumbnails

Note: Some statistics (like player counts, visits, etc.) use mock data for demonstration purposes. For production use, you would need to integrate with Roblox's authenticated APIs or use a third-party analytics service.
